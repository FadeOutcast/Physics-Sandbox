<h1>Physics Sandbox</h1>


Physics simulation created in C++ using SDL3 and ImGui.

The objective is to simulate an ideal gas then compare the velocities of the particles to a Maxwell Boltzmann Distribution.

Here is what the simulation looks like:

**Examples of simulated velocities vs boltzmann distribution at different temperatures:**

**Features:**

Gravity (Note that this is for demonstration only, the simulated velocities are different if this is enabled as the gravitational potential energy is converted to KE)

Circle collision detection

Controls for temperature, particle count and gravity

Up to 5000 particles spawned

Elastic Collision
